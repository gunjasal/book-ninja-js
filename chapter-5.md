# Functions for the master: closures and scopes
* closures reduce the amount and complexity of code needed to add advanced features, but also enable us to do things that otherwise wouldnâ€™t be possible, or would be too complex to be feasible.

## 5.1 Understanding closures
* A closure allows a function **to access and manipulate variables that are external** to that function.
* Closures allow a function to access all the variables, as well as other func- tions, that are in scope when the function itself is defined.
```
// Listing 5.1 A simple closure
var outerValue = "ninja";
function outerFunction(){
  assert(outerValue === "ninja","I can see the ninja.");
}
outerFunction();
```

```
// Listing 5.2 Another closure example
var outerValue = "samurai";
var later;
function outerFunction(){
  var innerValue = "ninja";
  
  function innerFunction(){
    assert(outerValue === "samurai", "I can see the samurai."); assert(innerValue === "ninja", "I can see the ninja.")
  }
  later = innerFunction;
}

outerFunction();
later();
```
