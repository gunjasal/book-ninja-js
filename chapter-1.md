## 1.1 Understanding the JavaScript language
* Functions are first-class objects - In JavaScript, functions coexist with, and can be treated like, any other JavaScript object.
* Function closures - function is a closure when it actively maintains (“closes over”) the external variables used in its body
* Scopes - Until recently, JavaScript didn’t have block-level variables (as in other C-like languages)
* Prototype-based object orientation - Unlike other mainstream programming lan- guages (such as C#, Java, and Ruby), which use class-based object orientation, JavaScript uses prototypes
* Generators, which are functions that can generate multiple values on a per- request basis and can suspend their execution between requests
* Promises, which give us better control over asynchronous code
* Proxies, which allow us to control access to certain objects
* Advanced array methods, which make array-handling code much more elegant
* Maps, which we can use to create dictionary collections; and sets, which allow us to deal with collections of unique items
* Regular expressions, which let us simplify what would otherwise be complicated pieces of code
* Modules, which we can use to break code into smaller, relatively self-contained pieces that make projects more manageable

#### 1.1.2 Transpilers give us access to tomorrow’s JavaScript today
* Traceur (https://github.com/google/ traceur-compiler) and Babel (https://babeljs.io/)

## 1.2 Understanding the browser
* The Document Object Model (DOM) - The DOM is a structured representation of the UI of a client-side web application that is, at least initially, built from the HTML code of a web application
* Events — A huge majority of JavaScript applications are event-driven applica- tions, meaning that most of the code is executed in the context of a response to a particular event. Examples of events include network events, timers, and user-generated events such as clicks, mouse moves, keyboard presses, and so on.

## 1.3 Using current best practices
## 1.4 Boosting skill transferability
* Desktop applications, by using, for example, NW.js (http://nwjs.io/) or Electron (http://electron.atom.io/)
* Mobile apps with frameworks, such as Apache Cordova (https://cordova .apache.org/)
* Server-side applications and applications for embedded devices with Node.js
