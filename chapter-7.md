# 7. Object orientation with prototypes
* A `prototype` is an object to which the search for a particular property can be dele- gated to. 
* Prototypes serve a similar purpose to that of classes in classical object-oriented languages.

## 7.1 Understanding prototypes
* objects are collections of named properties with values.
```
let obj = {
  prop1: 1, // value
  prop2: function () {}, // function
  prop3: {}, // other object
};
```
